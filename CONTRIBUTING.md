# Guidelines for contributing to the JSON Schema project

## Issues

Issues should identify an problem, enhancement, or use case; and propose some course of action for the draft. For alternate support channels, [see the json-schema.org website](http://json-schema.org/) or the [jsonschema tag on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsonschema).

## Pull requests

We welcome pull requests, both for editorial suggestions and to resolve open issues.

If the pull request would solve a particular issue, reference the issue in the pull request description.

Changes that would affect implementation behavior should typically be opened as an issue first.

Generally, pull requests should be made to the `main` branch.

Most PRs, will be left open for a minimum of 14 days.  Minor fixes may be merged more quickly once approved by a project member.

## Conduct

All official channels including the mailing list, GitHub organization, Slack server, and IRC channels, follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/json-schema-org/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
